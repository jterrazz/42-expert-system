C => E			# C implies E
A + B + C => D	# A and B and C implies D
A | B => C		# A or B implies C
A + !B => F		# A and not B implies F
C | !G => H		# C or not G implies H
V ^ W => X		# V xor W implies X
A + B => Y + Z	# A and B implies Y and Z
C | D => X 	# C or D implies X or V
A | B => X
E + F => !V		# E and F implies not V

=# Initial facts : A, B and G are true. All others are false.

				# If no facts are initially true, then a simple "=" followed
				# by a newline is used

?GVX			# Queries : What are G, V and X ?
# G is False
# V is True
# X is Conflict [True, False, False]
